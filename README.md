## Dense Correspondence Learning in PyTorch

The aim of this repo is to provide tools for dense correspondence learning in PyTorch.  In particular:

- Implementation of components used in for "Self-supervised Visual Descriptor Learning for Dense Correspondence" by T. Schmidt, R. A. Newcombe, D. Fox
- Training scripts to train models
- Integration with open-source RGBD fusion (ElasticFusion)
  
  
### Setup

Need to document this carefully later but the overview is:

- git submodule update --init --recursive



All development has actually happened inside Docker, and this workflow is also available:

- Get PyTorchDocker
- Clone in above repos
- Run docker
